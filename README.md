[![Blitz.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blitz-js/art/master/github-cover-photo.png)](https://blitzjs.com)

This is a [Blitz.js](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz) app.

# **crossfit-social**

## Getting Started

Run your app in the development mode.

We use [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) for our production/dev database. You will need to [download](https://docs.planetscale.com/tutorials/planetscale-quick-start-guide) `pscale` and be added to the team. Check out the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section to set the correct env vars.

After logging in through the cli, run `yarn db:start` to connect to the database.

Then you can start the development server.

```
blitz dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Environment Variables

Ensure the `.env.local` file has required environment variables:

```
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root@127.0.0.1:3309/crossfit-social-us-east"
```

Ensure the `.env.test.local` file has required environment variables:

Create MySQL db locally for running tests:

- `brew install mysql`
- `mysql_secure_installation`
- enter new password (i use `password`)
- `mysql -uroot -p`
- `create database crossfit_social_test;`

```
# .env.test.local
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:password@127.0.0.1:3306/crossfit_social_test"
```

## Tests

Runs your tests using Jest.

```
yarn test
```

Blitz comes with a test setup using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/).

## Commands

Blitz comes with a powerful CLI that is designed to make development easy and fast. You can install it with `npm i -g blitz`

```
  blitz [COMMAND]

  dev       Start a development server
  build     Create a production build
  start     Start a production server
  export    Export your Blitz app as a static application
  prisma    Run prisma commands
  generate  Generate new files for your Blitz project
  console   Run the Blitz console REPL
  install   Install a recipe
  help      Display help for blitz
  test      Run project tests
```

You can read more about it on the [CLI Overview](https://blitzjs.com/docs/cli-overview) documentation.

## Migrating PlanetScale with prisma

PlanetScale doesnt allow Prisma to create databases, so we need a dedicated branch. I set up the `shadow` branch for this purpose.

You'll need to add `SHADOW_DATABASE_URL` to your `.env.local`:

```
SHADOW_DATABASE_URL="mysql://root@127.0.0.1:3310/crossfit-social-us-east/shadow"
```

Then you can connect to it:

```
yarn db:start:shadow
```

Now you can run `yarn db:migrate` after making changes to `db/schema.prisma`.

## What's included?

These files are:

- The `app/` folder is a container for most of your project. This is where you’ll put any pages or API routes.

- `db/` is where your database configuration goes. If you’re writing models or checking migrations, this is where to go.

- `public/` is a folder where you will put any static assets. If you have images, files, or videos which you want to use in your app, this is where to put them.

- `integrations/` is a folder to put all third-party integrations like with Stripe, Sentry, etc.

- `test/` is a folder where you can put test utilities and integration tests.

- `package.json` contains information about your dependencies and devDependencies. If you’re using a tool like `npm` or `yarn`, you won’t have to worry about this much.

- `tsconfig.json` is our recommended setup for TypeScript.

- `.babel.config.js`, `.eslintrc.js`, `.env`, etc. ("dotfiles") are configuration files for various bits of JavaScript tooling.

- `blitz.config.ts` is for advanced custom configuration of Blitz. [Here you can learn how to use it](https://blitzjs.com/docs/blitz-config).

- `jest.config.js` contains config for Jest tests. You can [customize it if needed](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration).

You can read more about it in the [File Structure](https://blitzjs.com/docs/file-structure) section of the documentation.

### Tools included

Blitz comes with a set of tools that corrects and formats your code, facilitating its future maintenance. You can modify their options and even uninstall them.

- **ESLint**: It lints your code: searches for bad practices and tell you about it. You can customize it via the `.eslintrc.js`, and you can install (or even write) plugins to have it the way you like it. It already comes with the [`blitz`](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/tree/canary/packages/eslint-config) config, but you can remove it safely. [Learn More](https://blitzjs.com/docs/eslint-config).
- **Husky**: It adds [githooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks), little pieces of code that get executed when certain Git events are triggerd. For example, `pre-commit` is triggered just before a commit is created. You can see the current hooks inside `.husky/`. If are having problems commiting and pushing, check out ther [troubleshooting](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=troubleshoot) guide. [Learn More](https://blitzjs.com/docs/husky-config).
- **Prettier**: It formats your code to look the same everywhere. You can configure it via the `.prettierrc` file. The `.prettierignore` contains the files that should be ignored by Prettier; useful when you have large files or when you want to keep a custom formatting. [Learn More](https://blitzjs.com/docs/prettier-config).
